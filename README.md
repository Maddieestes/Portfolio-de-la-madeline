# Portfolio-de-la-madeline
Description:
I was motivated to create this project, so I would be able to have a functional and clean website to show case my work. I want to show potential employers what I am capable of making as well as an entertaining site for all users to visit. 

While creating this site I was able to practice using my HTML and CSS skills that I have learned in class. I learned so much regarding styling in CSS due to this challenge. 


Usage:
On my site you can read about me, click the links in the nav bar to see different sections on the page, you can also access my portfolio my clicking, and lastly you can see my contact info on the footer of the page.
